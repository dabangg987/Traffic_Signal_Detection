# Traffic_Signal_Detection
1. Here we  train a model with 43 different traffic signs which have a different meaning
2. Our model can help to create a more accurate autonomous vehicle.

### Here I attach a dataset link from where you can download the data and use this model for training of your own

## Steps:

### Setup:
1. Open jupyter notebook and give the name "Traffic_signal_prediction.ipynb" to your file.
2. Then first check all the requirements in your cmd using the requirements.txt file.
3. Then import all the necessary libraries.
4. Load the dataset
5. Train it.
6. Check model accuracy
7. Save the model in .hdf5 file format.

### Deployment
1. Create another .py file in the editor.
2. Import all the necessary libraries.
3. Then deploy your model as given in the "traffic_siganl_deploy_streamlit.py" file.
